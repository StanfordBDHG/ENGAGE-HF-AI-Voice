**Engage HF AI-Voice** is a [Vapor](https://vapor.codes/) server that integrates Twilio with OpenAI's real-time API (ChatGPT-4o) to enable voice-based conversations for healthcare data collection.

### Key Features

- **Twilio + OpenAI Integration**  
  Receives and streams audio to and from Twilio, relaying it in real-time to OpenAI's API.

- **Conversational AI on FHIR Questionnaires**  
  Configures ChatGPT-4o to conduct voice conversations based on a FHIR Questionnaire (e.g., `kccq12.json`) and records user responses in FHIR format on disk.

- **Customizable AI Behavior**  
  Includes function calling and system prompts to tailor the conversation flow and data handling.

---

## Configuration

You can customize the server in several ways:

- **Custom FHIR Questionnaire**  
  Replace the default FHIR R4 questionnaire (`Sources/App/Resources/kccq12.json`) with your own to change the conversation content.

- **System Message (AI Behavior)**  
  Edit the `systemMessage` constant in  
  `Sources/App/constants.swift`  
  This message sets the behavior of the AI and is passed to OpenAI during session initialization.

- **Session Configuration (Voice, Functions, etc.)**  
  Modify `sessionConfig.json` in  
  `Sources/App/Resources/`  
  This file controls OpenAI-specific parameters such as:
  - Which voice model to use
  - The available function calls (e.g., saving responses)
  - Other ChatGPT session settings

---

## Setup
You can either run the server in Xcode or using Docker.

### Xcode

To run the server locally using Xcode:

1. Add your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
   - Open the **Scheme Editor** (`Product > Scheme > Edit Schemeâ€¦`)
   - Select the **Run** section and go to the **Arguments** tab.
   - Add a new environment variable:  
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
     ```

2. Build and run the server in Xcode.
3. Start [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server:
   ```bash
    ngrok http http://127.0.0.1:5000
    ```
4. In your Twilio Console, update the "A call comes in" webhook URL to match the forwarding address from ngrok, appending `/incoming-call`.
Example: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/incoming-call`
5. Call your Twilio number and talk to the AI.

### Docker

To run the server using Docker:

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Open the **.env** file and insert your OpenAI API Key.
3. Build and start the server:
   ```bash
   docker compose build
   docker compose up app
   ```
4. Start [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to expose the local server:
   ```bash
    ngrok http http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```
5. In your Twilio Console, update the "A call comes in" webhook URL to match the forwarding address from ngrok, appending `/incoming-call`.
Example: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok-free.app/incoming-call`
6. Call your Twilio number and talk to the AI.

### Deployment

To deploy the service in a production environment, follow these steps:

0. **Prerequesites**
   Have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1. **Prepare the Deployment Directory**
   - Create a new directory on your target machine (e.g., `engage-hf-ai-voice`)
   - Copy the following files to this directory (e.g. with `scp` or by creating a empty file and copy over the content):
     - `docker-compose.prod.yml`
     - `nginx.conf`

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the deployment directory
   - Add your OpenAI API key like this:
     ```bash
     OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
     ```

3. **Set Up SSL Certificates**
   - Create the required SSL certificate directories:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir -p ./certs
     sudo mkdir -p ./private
     ```
   - Add your SSL certificates:
     - Place your certificate file which requies a full certificate chain (e.g., `certificate.pem`) in `./certs`
     - Place your private key file (e.g., `certificate.key`) in `./private`

   - Ensure proper permissions:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod 644 ./certs/certificate.pem
     sudo chmod 600 ./private/private.key
     ```

3.1. **Update file names in `nginx.conf`**
    - Depending on how your certificate and private key files are named, you need to adjust that in the `nginx.conf` file at:
     ```bash
     # SSL configuration with Stanford certificates
     ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/voiceai-engagehf.stanford.edu/certificate.pem;
     ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/voiceai-engagehf.stanford.edu/certificate.key;
     ```

4. **Start the Service**
   - Navigate to your deployment directory
   - Run the following command to start the service in detached mode:
     ```bash
     docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
     ```

The service should now be running and accessible via your configured domain.
You can test the health check endpoint, e.g. via curl, like that:
```bash
curl -I https://voiceai-engagehf.stanford.edu/health
```
